Description of the exam project:
Our exam project studied 236 patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery requiring a double- lumen endotracheal tube. Gender, age, MI, physical status, Mallampati score, smoking status, preoperative pain, surgery size, intervention and three outcomes (cough, sore throat and pain swollowing) at various time points are provided. 

Purpose of the exam project
The main purpose of the Script_main.R is to process, adjust and tidy the original dataset prior to vizualisation. 

The script contains the following steps: 
1. Downloading relevant libraries and importing datasets. 
2. Joining the two datasets together. 
3. Identifying any rows with NA and exploring the reason for it. The NAs was limited to two subject that probably dnf. We then decided to exclude them from the study. 
4. Identifying variable types, checking them up against codebook and then converted variables according to codebook.
5. Exploring dataset,rearranging dataset and enhancement of the dataset.
  - Renamed coloumns for clarity
  - Deleted unnessesary columns: we combined month and year into a common date coloum. 
  - Split the preOp_ASA_Mallampati score into ASA_Score and Mallampati_score. 
  - Added new coloumns which described 
      1)  change in cough severity from "extubation" to "morning the first           postoperative day". 
      2)  change in throat pain from 30 minutes after admission to PACU to           the "morning the first postoperative day"
  - Re-coded gender from numeric values to "Male" and "Female"
  - Reordered coloumns and removed unnecessary coloumns (month, year)
6. Identified and removed duplicates.
